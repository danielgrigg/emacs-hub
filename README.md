# Emacs Hub

A relocatable emacs config

## Installing

After cloning emacs-hub, simply type 
./install

To remove:
./remove

To update:
./update

## Plugins

## Notes

Only Aquamacs is supported for now. Supporting more platforms means 
either detecting the platform and adjusting the .emacs/preference files
or using say xemacs everywhere.

The hub touches both Aquamacs' directories plus .emacs.d. The latter
gives a more universal place to store config.
